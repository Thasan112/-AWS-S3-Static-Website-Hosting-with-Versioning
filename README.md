## 🔒 Why Versioning Matters

- **Prevents Data Loss** – Accidental overwrites or deletions can be undone.
- **Improves Auditability** – Track changes and maintain a clear history of updates.
- **Enables Rapid Rollbacks** – Quickly revert to any previous file state if issues arise.

## 📘 Additional Notes

This setup is ideal for personal projects, small business sites, or as part of a larger cloud-based architecture. While it’s simple to deploy, enabling versioning adds a powerful layer of control and reliability for production-ready environments.
